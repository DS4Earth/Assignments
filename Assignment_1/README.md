# Assignment 1: Intro to Python and Numpy #

Complete the Jupyter notebook in this repository using one of two options (your choice)

1) Open in Google Colaboratory by following the link below:
* Intro to Python [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DS4Earth/Assignments/blob/master/Assignment_1/intro_to_python.ipynb)

2) Open in the [ocean.pangeo.io](https://ocean.pangeo.io) binderhub, which is a Jupyter hub provided by the open-source geoscience project [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io). Pangeo operates two Jupyter hubs, [ocean.pangeo.io](https://ocean.pangeo.io) and [hyrdo.pangeo.io](hydro.pangeo.io). For this class, let's use ocean, but hydro can be a backup.
