# Assignment 1: Intro to Python and Numpy #

Complete the Jupyter notebook in this repository using one of two options (your choice)

1. Open in Google Colaboratory by following the link below:
* Intro to Python [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DS4Earth/Assignments/blob/master/Assignment_1/intro_to_python.ipynb)

2. Open in the [ocean.pangeo.io](https://ocean.pangeo.io) binderhub
* This is a Jupyter hub provided by the open-source geoscience project [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io). Pangeo operates two Jupyter hubs, [ocean.pangeo.io](https://ocean.pangeo.io) and [hyrdo.pangeo.io](hydro.pangeo.io). For this class, let's use ocean, but hydro can be a backup. 

* You will need to initially login to the pangeo server with your UNC (or Google) account infomration. Search for UNC Chapel Hill if using your UNC credentials, or simply use Google account. Once you've logged in, you will have a persistent Jupyter lab environment. It should be retained from session to session. However to avoid losing work, please be sure to push changes to github frequently.
